          I am a determined and ambitious developer with experience in web development and strong communication skills. Currently, I am learning English at a B1 level and actively enhancing my programming skills. My background in the food service industry has helped me develop excellent interpersonal abilities and the capacity to connect with diverse individuals, which is a vital aspect of teamwork.
<br/><br/>
I am proficient in HTML and CSS, creating responsive and cross-browser interfaces, and developing animations using pure technologies. In my development work, I utilize JavaScript and frameworks like React and Redux to build intuitive and dynamic web applications. I also have experience working with APIs, allowing me to effectively interact with the backend.
<br/><br/>
My constant desire to learn and master new technologies is one of my strengths. I actively use libraries such as Ant Design and Material-UI to accelerate development and create high-quality user interfaces. I am always ready to take on new challenges and expand my skills to make a meaningful contribution to the team.
<br/><br/>
You can view my work by visiting my projects, and I look forward to the opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills in your company to achieve common goals and ensure project success.
